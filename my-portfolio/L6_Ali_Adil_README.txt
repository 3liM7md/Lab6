## Features Implemented  

### **1- How does the portfolio work?**  
- The website consists of three main pages: **Home, About, and Projects**.
- Navigation between pages is managed using **React Router**.
- The **Navbar** component is reused across all pages for consistency.

### **2- How does error handling work?**

- The 404 page includes a message and a button to navigate back to the homepage.

### **3- How does deployment work?**  
- The frontend was deployed using **Netlify** via GitHub integration.
- The build directory (`dist/`) was used as the deployment source.
- The deployment URL was included in this README file.
